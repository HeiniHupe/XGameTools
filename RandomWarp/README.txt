This was developed for fun and is not completely stable.
Modifying your game with this tool may have unknown and undesired results.
Saved games maintain the state of the universe. If you shuffle the gates, save, then load, the changes will remain.
Likewise, loading a save made before modification will undo the changes.

This application runs on .NET Framework 4.8

1) Run X3 Terran Conflict and load into a save or start a new game
2) Ensure game is set to pause while tabbed out
3) Tab out of the game and Launch RandomWarp.exe
4) Set values in the GUI and click "Shuffle Gates"
5) Wait for the progress bar to finish, then return to the game

If there is no change RandomWarp.exe may need to be launched as administrator.
The program reads and modifies the game's memory, and therefor may require admin permissions.
