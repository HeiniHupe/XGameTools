 Because the tool is still in development, all components are subject to change.

 Main Features:
  - SectorObject Viewer.
  - Code injector.
  - Partial Multiplayer
 
 Code injector:
  The code injector injects binary directly into the game loop. Code can be read
  from a text file as shown in the mods folder. This tool is extreamly powerful and
  can be used maliciously. Do not run any code files unless you trust the file's
  source.
  
 Multiplayer:
  The multiplayer section of this tool is still in development and is unfinished.
  
  Default port: 25565
  
  How to connect:
   - Ensure both players have the game loaded in the background, idealy in the same sector.
   - Load the tool, go to Multiplayer, one player clicks host, the other connects with
     the IP of the host.
   - Once both players have recieved a connection message
     ("Opening connection..." for the host, "Connected!" for the client)
	 tab back into the game.
  
  Troubleshooting:
   - If a player does not recieve a connection message, either their inbound traffic is blocked,
     or the outbound traffic of the other computer is blocked.
